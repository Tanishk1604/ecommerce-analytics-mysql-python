# 🛒 E-Commerce Data Analysis with Python & MySQL

This project delivers a comprehensive data analysis of an e-commerce business using a real-world dataset from Kaggle. It combines the power of **SQL queries** with **Python-based data visualization** to uncover deep insights into customer behavior, product sales, seller performance, and time-based revenue trends.

The analysis is built around a **MySQL database** loaded with cleaned CSV data and accessed using Python. Visualizations are created using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**, making it easy to interpret sales patterns, consumer preferences, and business growth indicators.

Whether you're exploring user retention, analyzing revenue growth, or identifying top-performing products and sellers, this project shows how **SQL and Python together** can drive data-driven decisions in an e-commerce setting.
